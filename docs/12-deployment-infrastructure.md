# 🌍 Chapter 12: Deployment and Infrastructure

## 12.1 Local Installation (Docker Compose)

### Local Development and Testing Setup

Docker Compose enables quick local deployment for development, testing, and evaluation. This provides a complete system environment that can run on a single machine or development workstation.

## 12.2 Cloud Deployment (AWS/GCP/Azure/OVH)

### Cloud-Native Deployment Strategies

Cloud deployment leverages scalable infrastructure for production workloads. Multi-cloud support ensures flexibility and prevents vendor lock-in while optimizing for cost and performance.

## 12.3 Edge Computing (Raspberry Pi/Jetson Nano)

### Distributed Edge Architecture

Edge computing brings processing closer to vehicles and sensors, reducing latency and bandwidth requirements. Single-board computers provide cost-effective edge computing solutions.

## 12.4 High Availability and Resilience

### Production-Ready Infrastructure

High availability ensures system reliability through redundancy, failover mechanisms, and automated recovery. Geographic distribution provides resilience against regional outages.

## 12.5 Backup and Replication

### Data Protection and Business Continuity

Comprehensive backup and replication strategies protect against data loss and ensure business continuity. Multi-site replication provides disaster recovery capabilities.
