# 🧩 Chapter 11: Testing and Simulation

## 11.1 OBD-II Simulator (Python)

### OBD-II Simulation: Development Without Real Vehicles

OBD-II simulation provides a controlled environment for testing vehicle control systems without requiring physical access to vehicles. This enables development, testing, and validation in any environment.

## 11.2 CAN/BMS Virtual Generators

### Virtual CAN Network Simulation

CAN bus simulation enables testing of vehicle communication protocols without physical hardware. Virtual BMS (Battery Management System) simulation provides realistic battery behavior models for testing charging and energy management algorithms.

## 11.3 Complete Test Environment via Docker

### Containerized Testing Infrastructure

Docker-based testing environments provide reproducible, isolated testing scenarios that can run anywhere. This ensures consistent testing across development, staging, and production environments.

## 11.4 Web Demo (UI Connected to Simulated Data)

### Demonstration Interface with Simulated Data

The web demo provides an interactive showcase of OpenVehicleControl capabilities using simulated vehicle data. This enables stakeholders to experience the system functionality without requiring live vehicle connections.
